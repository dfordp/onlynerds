## 🧩 Problem We're Solving

EdTech is broken:
- ❌ Centralized platforms hide their models and charge unpredictable fees.
- ❌ Low-quality courses flood the market without accountability.
- ❌ Learners can’t prove what they know in the real world.
- ❌ Educators struggle to launch, monetize, or remix practical content.

## 🌍 Our Solution: Only Nerds

A **decentralized AI-native LMS** where:
- 🧠 **Courses can be forked** and remixed like Git repos.
- 🎓 Learners follow **milestone-driven learning** with real exercises, not passive videos.
- 🧬 AI tracks learning and **mints skill NFTs** as proof-of-knowledge (PoL).
- 💡 Community-curated creators replace review bombs with verifiable reputation.
- 💼 Post-course **bounty board** lets learners apply skills on real-world gigs.
